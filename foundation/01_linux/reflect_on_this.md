# Reflect on This â€“ Linux Permissions

This document contains reflections on the security and practical applications of Linux file and directory permissions.

## 1. File vs. Directory Permissions  
The **execute (x)** permission has different meanings depending on whether it is applied to a file or a directory:  

- **For files**: The execute permission allows the file to be run as a program or script. Without it, the file can be read or written (depending on other permissions), but it cannot be executed.  
- **For directories**: The execute permission allows a user to **enter and navigate** inside the directory. Without execute permission, even if you have read permission on the directory, you cannot list or access files inside it.  

ðŸ‘‰ This makes execute essential for directories because without it, you canâ€™t move into the directory or access its contents, even if you know the filenames.

## 2. The 777 Risk  
Granting `777` permissions means **any user** on the system can read, write, and execute the file or directory.  

- **Scenario on a web server:**  
  Suppose a PHP configuration file (`config.php`) that stores database credentials is given `777` permissions.  
  - An attacker could upload a malicious PHP file to the server.  
  - Since the directory and file are world-writable, the attacker could modify `config.php` to execute arbitrary commands.  
  - This could lead to full compromise of the database and possibly the entire website/server.  

ðŸ‘‰ Thus, `777` should be avoided because it removes all security boundaries.

## 3. Symbolic vs. Octal `chmod`  
Imagine a file with the following permissions:  
-rwx-w-r--


Now you only want to **add group execute permission** without changing any other permissions.  

- If you try using **octal mode**, you need to recalculate the exact numeric representation for the updated permissions, which can be error-prone and could accidentally overwrite other permissions.  
- If you use **symbolic mode**:  

```bash
chmod g+x a_file.txt
```

This safely adds execute permission for the group only, without touching other bits.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why symbolic mode is safer and better for making small, precise permission changes.

# 4. sudoâ€™s Power

Suppose you meant to run:
```bash
rm -rf ./temp_files/
```

But instead you accidentally typed:
```bash
sudo rm -rf / temp_files/
```

Hereâ€™s what happens:

 - sudo elevates the command to superuser privileges, bypassing normal safety checks.

The command is interpreted as:

- rm -rf / â†’ recursively deletes everything from the root directory /, effectively wiping out the entire operating system.

- temp_files/ would then be treated as a separate target, but by that point the system is already destroyed.

ðŸ‘‰ With sudo, this mistake becomes catastrophic because the command has the power to delete all system files and data irreversibly.
